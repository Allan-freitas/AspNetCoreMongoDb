# Introduction 
The project demonstrates the use of Asp.net Core 3.1 and mongodb together with Repository pattern. As soon as I have more time to work on this I will try to demonstrate how to use it with AutoMapper

# Getting Started

1.	Installation process is very simple, you just need to clone the projetct and restore all the packages (visual studio should do it for you), 
	after that just use CTRL + F5  to start the projetct locally in you machine.
2.	Software dependencies
	* [MongoDb Driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/csharp/) - MongoDb Driver
	* [Asp.Net Core 3.1](https://asp.net/) - Net Core SDK 3.1 - The web framework used
	* [MongoDB.Bson](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/) - BSON is a binary serialization format used to store documents and make remote procedure calls in MongoDB.
	* [AutoMapper](https://docs.automapper.org/en/stable/Getting-started.html) - AutoMapper is an object-object mapper.
	* [FluentValidation](https://fluentvalidation.net/) - validation rules for a particular object
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# Build and Test
 * To build the solution (Visual Studio) you just need to use CTRL + F5.
